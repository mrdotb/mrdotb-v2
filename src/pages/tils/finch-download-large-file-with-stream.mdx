In this TIL, we will explore how to download large files using the Finch HTTP client library in Elixir. [Finch](https://github.com/sneako/finch) is a highly efficient, concurrent HTTP client that utilizes the powerful concurrency features provided by Elixir.

The following code demonstrates how to download a large zip file using Finch:

```elixir
path = "/tmp/big-file.zip"
file = File.open!(path, [:write, :exclusive])
url = "https://domain.com/url/big-file.zip"
request = Finch.build(:get, url)

Finch.stream(request, Lor.Finch, nil, fn
  {:status, status}, _ ->
    IO.inspect("Download assets status: #{status}")

  {:headers, headers}, _ ->
    IO.inspect("Download assets headers: #{inspect(headers)}")

  {:data, data}, _ ->
    IO.binwrite(file, data)
end)
```

This code snippet downloads a large zip file, storing it in the `/tmp` directory. We first build the Finch request using `Finch.build/2`, and then stream the response by calling `Finch.stream/4`. By streaming the response, we can efficiently handle large files without consuming excessive memory. The data chunks are written directly to the file using `IO.binwrite/2` as they are received, making it an ideal approach for downloading large files.
