}

When working with private Elixir libraries hosted on GitHub, integrating them into your CI pipeline requires a few specific steps. Here's a guide to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Specify the Private Repository in `mix.exs`

In your `mix.exs` file, declare the dependency using the GitHub repository information. Using a specific commit hash is recommended to avoid potential issues with branch names due to CI caching.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:private_repo, github: "username/private_repo", ref: "commit"},
    # Using a commit hash ensures consistency as branch names might change.
    ...
  ]
end
```

### Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Visit the [GitHub PAT settings](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
2. Set the **Expiration** field to `No expiration` (for long-term CI use; remember to rotate tokens periodically for security).
3. Under **Repository Access**, select the private repository you want to grant access to.
4. In **Permissions**, set the following to `Read-only`:
   - Commit statuses
   - Contents
   - Pull requests
   - Metadata
5. Generate the token and copy it.
6. Add this token as a secret in your CI/CD pipeline, e.g., as `PAT`.

### Add the GitHub Token to Your CI Job
In the CI configuration, add the `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a build argument. For example, in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build and Push Docker image to GHCR
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
    labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
    build-args: |
      MIX_ENV=small
      BUILD_METADATA=${{ steps.meta.outputs.json }}
      ERL_FLAGS=+JPperf true
      GITHUB_TOKEN=${{ secrets.PAT }}
```

### Update the Dockerfile
To allow `git` to access private repositories, configure the GitHub token in the Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# We need this for git to access private repos
ARG GITHUB_TOKEN

...

# Configure git to use the GITHUB_TOKEN in the URL
RUN git config --global url."https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/" \
    && mix deps.get --only $MIX_ENV
```

This configuration ensures that your Docker build process can pull private repositories using the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Summary
By following these steps:
1. Define your private repository in `mix.exs`.
2. Generate and securely store a GitHub Personal Access Token.
3. Configure your CI/CD pipeline to use the token as a build argument.
4. Update your Dockerfile to configure `git` for private repo access.

Your CI pipeline will now be able to fetch private dependencies, streamlining the build process for Elixir projects.
