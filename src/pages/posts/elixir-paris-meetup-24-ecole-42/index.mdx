# Elixir Paris Meetup #24

I organized the [Elixir Paris Meetup #24](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/elixir/events/301199042/) at [noc 42](https://42.fr/) in Paris with the help of [Nicolas Talfer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-talfer/).

## The Talks

We had two talks during the meetup.

### Talk 1: Writing NIFs with Rustler

The first talk was presented by me, focusing on writing Native Implemented Functions (NIFs) using Rustler.
[Check out the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Im8or5OhHH39IdxR7TtDUOFCTpm4MH5xvA-Vo8hisik/edit?usp=sharing).

### Talk 2: Unit Testing in Elixir - Tips and Tricks

The second talk was delivered by [Nicolas Talfer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-talfer/), covering valuable tips and tricks for unit testing in Elixir.
[Check out the slides](/posts/elixir-paris-meetup-24-ecole-42/slide-unit-testing.pdf) and the [repository](https://github.com/nicolas-talfer/ljdc/).

## The Live Stream

For the first time, the Elixir Paris Meetup was broadcasted live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2165182272). Although the sound quality needs improvement, we are optimistic about enhancing the experience in future streams.

## The Afterwork

We organized a crowdfunding campaign to buy drinks and food for the afterwork session, and it was a success. My lovely wife helped prepare kimbap for everyone, and our alchemists' team set up trays beautifully.

## Conclusion

Organizing this meetup was a challenging yet rewarding experience. Despite my lack of expertise in event organization, practice makes perfect, and I'm eager to do it again!
